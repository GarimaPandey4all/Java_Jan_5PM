Java

main method?

- main is an entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert convert it inot byte code, but it cannot execute the code or interpret the code


Why main is public?

- public: global, which is accessible for all from anywhere

- JRE uses main
- Java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load your class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside your directory
- And outside the package things can access

Why main is Static?

- static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded.

Why main is void?

- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

Main Arguments: String[] args

String: data type
[]- array
args: arguments

- main has command line arguments
- we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array
- All arguments are pass to main in form of array of String

What is String?

- It is a collection of characters
- String internally a char[]
- String is a predefined class in java as it is in capital letter

What is System.out.println()?

- println() - print in new line, println comes from out object
- out - out is an predefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System is a predefined class used for input, output, error
e.g: System.in, System.out, System.err

Println vs Print

- println: print in new line
- print: here cursor remains at the end of the text

Can we overload main()?

- yes, we can overload the main
- when we execute the class, JVM starts execution with public static void main(String[] args)
