Encapsulation: wrapping variables and methods into a single unit is called encapsulation
e.g: class

Good/Secure Encapsulation: Data Hiding + Encapsulation

Constructor

Q1. Need to initialize the member variable when object is construct/create.
Ans: We need constructor for this.

- constructor is call when you create an object
- So constructor will initialize the member variable
- constructor name is same as class name
- constructor never return anything
- It is called only once
- One class can have multiple constructors, so this thing is called constructor overloading
- Every class by default have default constructor
- So if you create any other constructor the default one is killed

constructor has types:

1. default constructor
2. parameterized constructor

This keyword: It can hold current object's reference

1. To differentiate the instance and local varibales

2. To use default and parameterized constructor at a time

When we need multiple constructor calls in a sinle call
sol: we need constructor chaining for this.
this keyword also use for constructor chaining

What is Package in java?

- Package is a folder / directory behind the scene
- Package is a collection of classess, interfaces
- We divide a big problem into small-2 packages
- So we can group the similar code in same kind of packages

e.g:

Class Relationship: Inheritance
- communicate b/w classes

1. IS-A Inheritance
- BMW is a car
- Savingaccount is a account
- Lion is a animal

2. HAS-A Inheritance
- BMW has a driver
- Customer has a account
- customer has a order

- Inheritance: parent child relationship
	by using extends keyword

- code reuse

Overriding:

When parent feature is outdated so we override the parent feature in a child
Overriding hide the parent feature

- Must be inheritance
- Method signature must be same
void roi(), same child has same void roi()


Abstract Concept

- Abstraction: only share essential information not internal

- Abstract Methods: can only be declared, not defined
- Abstract Class: can have abstract methods
- You can't create objects of abstract class

Mutliple Inheritance

	p1      p2

Interface

- because it supports multiple inheritance / interface
- it is also provide total abstraction
