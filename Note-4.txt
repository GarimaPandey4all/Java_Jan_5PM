- During a execution time

RAM: Random Access Memory

- Temporary Memory
- Primary Memory
- Main Memory

- Heap: Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Stack: Static Memory Allocation

b) Maos G.C (Old Gen)

String Handling:

- String internally char[]
- e.g: String name = "Amit"
- String is a predefine class in java
- So it has some predefined functions
- It is also treat like a Data type
- String is a final class, so you can't inherit it
- String objects are created in 2 ways

a) String Literal Style
e.g: String name = "Amit";

b) String Object Style
e.g: String name = new String("Amit");

- String use String pool
- String objects are immutable
String doesn't change existing or original objects, it can create new memory or object all the time.

Solution of String immutable is: StringBuffer and StringBuilder (because they are mutuable)
- Mutuable is that it doesn't create new objects or memory
